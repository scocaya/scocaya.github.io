      <h1>pronounce</h1>
      <p>a small elaboration on my pronouns.</p>
      <p>.... <big>they them,</big> one ones, <small>hy hym, ae aer, dei deim, che cher</small></p>
      <p>my most preferred pronouns are <big>he him, they them, and one ones.</big> the rest i technically go by but don't expect to be frequently used.</p>
      <p>oh scott, why do you just write he him then?</p>
      <p><i>i think</i> he him is enough for the stranger to know. that's why i'll always intially introduce myself with he him.</p>
      icl, this is mostly due to some bad experiences being stereotyped and mocked for using they them. the lengths people go to to ignore acknowledging basic grammar confounds me. if you're about to flock to my guestbook to do so, save yourself the trouble. i've heard it before. if you're genuinely curious on how to use them, please look <a href="https://pronouns.org/they-them">here</a>.
    <p>if we talk again and it comes up, i'll be sure to mention that they them is perfectly fine for me as well, but that's probably why the first time we met, i introduced myself with he him. also just clarifying here if you didn't know <b>i am not a man.</b> this is something i've noticed i've had to repeat quite a bit which is understandable. i'm trans<i>masc</i>, not a trans man. which there's nothing wrong with being such, but i am not so.</p>
      <p>yo scott, i don't think i've heard anyone use any of your neos on you. are they something you would like me to use more often?</p>
      <p>admittedly, i tend to use neopronouns more often on the internet. if you'd like to refer to me as such in real life, be my guest. if not, that's fine too :3</p>
      <p>hi scott, so wtf is a neopronoun?</p>
      <p> please look <a href="https://pronouns.org/neopronouns">here</a>, but i'm free to answer any questions <i>in good faith</i>!</p>
